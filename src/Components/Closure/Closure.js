                I did learn a lot throughout this challenge. I have gotten so much more exposure in areas regarding web development, databases, and system design. I have gotten so much more prepared and was able to ace my interviews throughout this project. I got more exposure with backend tools and how to modulate and organize code and READMEs. I wish I gave myself more exposure in other areas of software engineering and I didn't spend so much time on Sudoku but I really did enjoy working on this project.

                So I've decided to end the hundred days of code challenge on day 42. I have decided to drop this challenge with school approaching and my workload for next quarter is going to be pretty big.I think one of the best tricks to stay on top of this challenge is to plan ahead on what you want to accomplish so you aren't scrambling or working on random things. I am pretty happy that I was able to go 42 days of this challenge with only 2 days dropped due to me being sick. I would highly recommend trying this challenge if you have never tried it before. I hope to try this challenge again next summer when I have more time but I really do recommend trying this atleast once.
